# Bugworx

This repository contains the Bugworx front-end template.

## Overview

- Project structure: HTML pages are under `src/` and assets (CSS/JS/images/fonts) are in `src/assets/`.
- The `dist/` folder is the production build output. It should be generated by the build process and can be served or deployed.

## Building (update `dist`)

These instructions assume you have Node.js and either `npm` or `yarn` installed. Use PowerShell on Windows.

1. Install dependencies (run once):

```powershell
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

2. Run the build task that creates `dist`.

If the project uses Gulp (common for this template):

```powershell
npx gulp build
# or if gulp is installed globally
# gulp build
```

Or if there is an npm script named `build` in `package.json`:

```powershell
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

When the build completes successfully the `dist/` folder will be created or updated.

## Troubleshooting

- If `npm run build` or `npx gulp build` fails:
  - Inspect the terminal output for the error message.
  - Common issues: missing dependencies, wrong Node.js version, or missing `gulpfile.js`/`package.json` scripts.
  - If you see errors, copy the full error output and open an issue or paste it here for help.

- If `dist/` already exists but isn't being updated, try cleaning first:

```powershell
# If using gulp
npx gulp clean && npx gulp build
```

- Confirm there is a `gulpfile.js` at the repository root. If it's missing, the project might not use Gulp and instead relies on another build tool (Rollup, Webpack, etc.).

## Git ignore `dist`

To ignore the `dist` folder in git, add the following line to `.gitignore` at the repository root:

```
/dist
```

If the `dist` folder is already tracked by git, stop tracking it with:

```powershell
git rm -r --cached dist
git commit -m "Remove dist from repository tracking"
```
